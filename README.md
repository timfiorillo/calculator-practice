Dead simple calculator app for practice.

Built using:
• HTML
• CSS
• Javascript

v1 - store given values in variables, create buttons to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. 
    (custom variation) - added CLEAR button to 0 the result.
    
Need to revisit later and add ability for user to define own values to calculate.
